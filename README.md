# About Caked by Kimberly

This application will solve a customer having to use personal contact or Instagram for ordering baked goods from Kimberly.  
Kimberly will have an application where her customers can create custom made cakes.  A set of predetermined parameters and ingredients will be available for customers to design their own custom made cake.  Orders will be saved and users will have the ability to view and edit all the orders.

This app was first started as a project for Capstone #1 while Adam Featherston obtaining a web development certification from "Nashville Software School" (NSS).

# Features of the App

The user can register and login with an email address.  Two views will exist:
    1 view for customers
    1 view for “employees” (Kimberly and Adam)
A customer can CREATE/place a new cake order.
A customer can see all of their own orders.
Employees can see all orders.
Employees can edit the property value of an order to show it is in the baking process.
Employees can see a list of all the customers.
The customer can DELETE their own order.
A customer can edit their own custom order.
Orders are sorted by date needed.  
Customers and employees can edit their own profile
Employees have the ability to prevent an order from being deleted or edited once the baking process has begun.

# Future features of the App to be developed

A customer can create a custom order for cupcakes and cookies (different options than a cake).
An employee can CREATE a new seasonal item for customers to buy.
Seasonal baked goods will have a date set, and the customer will not be able to order any of these items after that date.
Search feature for customers in the seasonal baked goods list.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# json-server database.json -p 8088 -w

Runs the JSON server for the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) to view it in your browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
